# A-novel-feature-relearning-method

Prepare dataset:
    We evaluated our model with the Sleep-EDF dataset. The data set is publicly available on the Internet http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/. When using this resource, please cite the original publication: B Kemp, AH Zwinderman, B Tuk, HAC Kamphuisen, JJL Obery√©. Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave micro continuity of the EEG. IEEE-BME 47(9):1185-1194 (2000). To comply with the AASM recommendations, this paper combines N3 and N4 stages into a single N3 and removes the movement and unknown data.
